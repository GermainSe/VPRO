Main.cpp includes 
    #include "includes/weights [16 / 64].h"
        depending on weights Lib data precision (Check CmakeListsAdd.txt for which cpp/data Array is used)
        used by C-Code reference

    the calculation of the CNN with C-Code using the weights.h file from the Converter/preprocessor
        optional floating point precision (no cut to 24/16-bit)
        optional bitlength (32/64-bit, only matters if floating point)
        the result (last Layer) may be saved as binary (16-bit precision)|image (8-bit precision)
        the result can be loaded (instead of recalculation) [ONLY 16-bit / fixed point precision]

    the calculation of the CNN with Darknet using the .weights & .cfg files from YOLO
        result shown with opencv as overlay of found BBoxes

    the calculation of the CNN with VPRO functions using the simulator and weights.h from the Conv/preproc
        the result (last Layer) may be saved as binary (16-bit precision)|image (8-bit precision) [ONLY if comparision is acitve]
        the result can be loaded (instead of recalculation)
        the result may be compared to binary result of C-Code implementation
        the result may be processed to get BBox (+visualization) [ONLY manual/visual compare of TF results and this]

    the comparision (automatic) of C-Code execution with VPRO execution
        based on 16-bit (cut) values of result arrays
        
includes/defines.h
    sets defines for execution of different functions (like Darknet Reference, ...)
