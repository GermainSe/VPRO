	load_model.py
		"TopLevel"
		- settings in first rows...
		loads pb and executes using complete net
		creates log in tensorboard 
			previous log cleaned
		runs through all tensors (subnet, no pre and post-processing)
			evaluates them (get intermediate results)
			converts BN into weights+bias
			gets index for residual input or shortcuts
			calls c_header_write() for Relu, Bias & Add Tensors 
				as they include a conv,... to run on vpro in one "layer"
	c_header_write performs 
		- configuration in first rows...
		fixp analysis and converts the weights+bias to fixp
		[Obsolete] verify (verify_conv_bias_layer.py - float & verify_conv_bias_fixp.py - fixp) if configured
		contains array for layer dependent input connection (global variable)
		write out of tf results
